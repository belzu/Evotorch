# Evotorch
Evotorch is a neuro-evolution library written in Python that makes use of the Pytorch library formalism.
It allows the evolution of multilayer and convolutional networks.
This project was conceived as my end-of-degree project at UPV/EHU university.

Evotorch uses genetic algorithms (a paradigm of evolutionary algorithms) in order to obtain a neural network that contains the best combination of values
for a user-elected set of hiperparameters so that a given problem (in the form of a CSV file) can be solved.
